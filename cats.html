    <h1>Kittens</h1>
    <p>Kittens are tiny, cute baby cats. They love to play all the time and are very curious about everything around them. Kittens have soft fur and big, bright eyes. They like to cuddle and purr when they're happy. Kittens need lots of love, care, and attention, just like puppies do.</p>
